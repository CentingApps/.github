# CentingApps

CentingApps is an application project inspired by the fact that Indonesia have a large problem of stunting. It is created to face the problem by making it easier to test or detect if the person is stunting or not without actually needed to go to public health center or hospital with a heavy fee. To do so we applied not only the cloud computing side but also the machine learning side of technology.

## Features

- Detect Stunting
- History
- Separated data for each child
- Language English/Indonesia



## Technical Details

**Mobile Application**

The mobile application is made starting by the UI/UX using platform figma creating the Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi model, which then implemented using native Kotlin Android by utilizing supporting libraries such as Retrofit, Tensorflow, etc.

**Cloud Computing**

<!--dijelasin pake apa apanya terus tambahin cloud architecture sama database structurenya sama link reponya apa aja boleh di masukin disini-->

**Machine Learning**

<!--dijelasin model machine learning stunting kita kayak gimana apa aja hasilnya dll.-->
