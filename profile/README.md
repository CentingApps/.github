# CentingApps

CentingApps is an application project inspired by the fact that Indonesia have a large problem of stunting. It is created to face the problem by making it easier to test or detect if the person is stunting or not without actually needed to go to public health center or hospital with a heavy fee. To do so we applied not only the cloud computing side but also the machine learning side of technology.
